# Tokenable

## Project Abstract
This project is an application that serves as a password saver that will periodically remind the user to change their password for added security measures. The passwords that will be used are not ordinary text fields but stored images/biometrics accesed through the use of the a phones camera as a scanner. These 'tokens' are then used to to unlock the users synched accounts. Upon succesful 'scan' the user will be redirected to the specified account while logged in.

## Conceptual Design
As this is a ground up project proposal, we will be starting from scratch. Functionality will be develped in pieces. Chosing 1 functionality at a time would enable a gradule process of development. The basics of this project consist of a login screen, accounts page, settings, and other smaller details that would be developed in time.

## Background
For detailed background information on this project, refrence [this](https://github.com/HunterLaut/IndividualProjectProposal/blob/master/test%20(1).pdf) document.
This project is a new startup. There is a basic prototype that simulates some its functionality.

***Test Case Document***    
Use [this](https://github.com/HunterLaut/IndividualProjectProposal/blob/master/TestCaseAssessmentHMC%20(3).pdf) document to perform tasks that give insight on using the application.

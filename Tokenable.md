# Tokenable

## Project Abstract
This project is an application that serves as a password saver that will periodically remind the user to change their password for added security measures. The passwords that will be used are not ordinary text fields but stored images/biometrics accesed through the use of the a phones camera as a scanner. These 'tokens' are then used to to unlock the users synched accounts. Upon succesful 'scan' the user will be redirected to the specified account while logged in.

# Tokenable
Access Lautenbacher_Tokenable for Prototype

## Project Abstract  

This project is an application that serves as a password saver that will periodically remind the user to change their password for added security measures. The passwords that will be used are not ordinary text fields but stored images/biometrics accessed through the use of the a phones camera as a scanner. These 'tokens' are then used to to unlock the users synched accounts. Upon successful 'scan' the user will be redirected to the specified account while logged in.

## Conceptual Design
As this is a ground up project proposal, we will be starting from scratch. Functionality will be developed in pieces. Choosing 1 functionality at a time would enable a gradual process of development. The basics of this project consist of a login screen, accounts page, settings, and other smaller details that would be developed in time.
